I have done a lot of cool stuff, but I have failed myself by not documenting the step-by-step process of solving problems, doing projects, etc. This website is my formal step into the realm of becoming better documented, and I think it may be helpful to create a sort of guide for what it took me to get here, in case you are in the same boat as I. Through outlining my exact process of creating this, I will be repeating some of what the author of this website theme, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>, said so I must credit and thank <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat">alshedivat</a> on Github for the amazing work he has done.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="steps">Steps</h2> <p>Creation of this site started with picking a hosting method. I had Github accounts, but I wanted to own one under my primary moniker if I was going to put so much work into it. Of course, Github natively supports Jekyll theming for Github Pages, so that is the route I took.</p> <p>1.) When your account is created, you can create a new repository if you want to start writing your website yourself, and name it “[username].github.io.” At this point I had already done some research and found that I wanted the al-folio theme, and alshedivat makes it really easy to clone the repository by clicking a <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&amp;template_owner=alshedivat">link</a> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSTALL.md</code> file.</p> <p>2.) These next few steps are also straight from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">INSTALL.md</code> file, so I will just paste them here: In this new repository, go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings -&gt; Actions -&gt; General -&gt; Workflow permissions</code> and give Read and write permissions to GitHub Actions.</p> <p>3.) Open file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>, set url to https://<your-github-username>.github.io and leave baseurl empty (do NOT delete it), as baseurl:. Wait until the GitHub action with subtitle Deploy site finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~4 min. Now, in addition to the master branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch. While you are here, you can update some additional base information if you want.</your-github-username></p> <details><summary>Click here for code</summary> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">

Finally, in the repository page go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings -&gt; Pages -&gt; Build and deployment</code>, make sure that Source is set to Deploy from a branch and set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to master).</p> <p>5.) Wait until the GitHub action pages-build-deployment finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~45s, then simply navigate to https://<your-github-username>.github.io in your browser.

To begin customizing my site, I started by editing the home page. I value simplicity in my site, and there are already tabs to share my blog posts and whatnot, so I removed everything but the ‘social’ section from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\_layouts\about.liquid</code> file.</p> <details><summary>Click here for code</summary> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="p">

  </code></pre></figure> </details> <p>With the layout adjusted, I was able to quickly and easily update the text in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_pages/about.md</code> file to be what I needed. To change the profile picture, simply navigate the the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/img/</code> location and replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prof_pic.jpg</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">prof_pic_color.png</code> files to the image of your choice. Changing th edescription was</p> <p>7.) The next thing I wanted to do was get my CV/resume updated. This part was rather easy - but something to know is that there is a primary <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/assets/json/resume.json</code> file, that contains all of the fields that one may want; however, there is another file for backup called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cv.yml</code> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_data/</code> location. Due to the formatting differences and the lack of edits needed, I opted to rename the resume file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">resume1.json</code> and use the .yml file instead.</p> <p>8.) The template thankfully comes with a bunch of different navigation tabs where you can have a blog, post projects, talk about your fellow researchers, etc. For my purposes, I didn’t really need all of those things, so I renamed one of the tabs (I believe it was ‘people’) to document and talk about my CTF team, and I kept the about, blog, and cv pages. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_pages/</code> folder contains all of the pages, and editing that ‘people’ page really only required updating the permalink, changing the ‘nav_order,’ and finally updating the .md filename to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ctf.md</code>. Of note, I picked this particular page to edit because the layout worked the best for my purpose, but it is important to note that there are different layouts available in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_layouts/</code> location.</p> <details><summary>Click here for code</summary> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-markdown" data-lang="markdown"><span class="p">

      nav_order: 4
<span class="p">      ---
    
  </span></code></pre></figure> </details> <p>9.) Similar to the example above, the only adjustments needed to remove pages from the navigation bar was editing the applicable .md files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_pages/</code> location, changing the ‘nav’ value to false, and adjusting the ‘nav_order’ to something like ‘9.’ The reason I found the last part to be necessary, was because if a page had ‘nav’ as false but ‘nav_order’ 2, then there would be a gap in the navigation bar.</p> <p>10.) With basically everything in order, the final piece before the blog (so I have something presentable while I tackled creating write-ups), was updating the favicon, changing the site footer, adding my desired socials to the home page, and adjusting the tags that are used for indexing posts in the blog. This is all stuff that is handled in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/config.yml</code> file. Below are the value changes I made - I will not include all of the text from the file because it is a lot, but maybe it could still be helpful.</p> <p>The favicon is controlled with a value called ‘icon’ under the ‘site settings.’ I just used the profile picture for ease:</p> <details><summary>Click here for code</summary> <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">

The pages can be renamed or deleted largely with no issue, so I began writing what would become this post, as well as another for a CTF challenge that I had documented completing.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2> <p>One of the first problems I ran into with the site was some JSON formatting stuff. This led me to restart and clone my repository, install Jupyter, Ruby and Jekyll locally via Homebrew (I am a Mac user by day), and host my site statically. If you do it this way, don’t forget to add Ruby to the $PATH: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc</code>.</p> <p>This worked well because I could run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve --trace</code> to ‘bundle’ the site from the repository file location, go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">httpx[:]//localhost:4000</code> and view site changes instantly, but then I had issues pushing the changes back up to the Main branch which is an issue that I still have not resolved. For this reason, I ended up going back to editing straight in Github, which is maybe not preferred because it is really easy to break everything and get lost, but I adopted the methodology of only making small changes at a time and actually documenting the changes in the comments so they could easily be reverted if something did break. My commit history is atrocious to say the least, but the site works.</p> <p>Something additionally interesting about Jekyll running locally, is that when it ‘bundled’ the site, it created a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/_site/</code>. I had not previously done any research about why this may be, but it is a temporary folder. When I was making changes to the blog locally, they kept getting reverted and I couldn’t figure out why, but it turned out that I was editing the temporary files. I advise not messing with that temporary folder, it will save you some trouble!</p> <hr/> <h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</h2> <p>This is some filler text…</p>]]></content><author><name>Metassassin</name></author><category term="write-ups"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My first write-up]]></summary></entry></feed>
