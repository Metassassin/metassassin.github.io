As I have previously mentioned, I am the captain of a CTF team called Hellbound. The nuts and bolts of it, is that my team is assembled of complex puzzle solvers with different specialties and skills. We are comprised of students, artists, mathematicians, etc. The puzzles that we solve are very technical, and dip into the realm of hacking (dramatic music intensifies). It really isn't as mystical as it may seem, all it means is that the team is very intelligent, but we hone our skills to drive security and privacy into the future for the better.

The competitive side of these events is global, hosting teams from every technical, occupied nation in the world.
