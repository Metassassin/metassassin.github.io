<h2>Background</h2>
As I have previously mentioned, I am the captain of a CTF team called Hellbound. The nuts and bolts of it, is that my team is assembled of complex puzzle solvers with different specialties and skills. We are comprised of mostly USA based students, artists, hackers, etc. The puzzles that we solve can be very technical, and operate in categories like reverse engineering, OSINT, PWN, cryptography, blockchain, etc. Hacking really isn't as mystical as it may seem, all it means is that the team is very intelligent, but we hone our skills to drive improvements in security and privacy practices.

The competitive side of these events is global, hosting teams from every technical, occupied nation in the world. If teams compete at a high enough level, there are financial (and other) incentives and rewards. Ranked agains the whole world, <a href="https://ctftime.org/team/243673">Hellbound</a> is in the top 300, and we are top 30 in the United States. We are only getting better, and we are always on the lookout for talent that is committed to competing.

Our goal is to provide opportunities for competitors of all kinds to get better. We are working on a website, hosting our own event, and creating resources that will be helpful to newbies and pros.
