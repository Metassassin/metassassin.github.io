As I have previously mentioned, I am the captain of a CTF team called Hellbound. The nuts and bolts of it, is that my team is assembled of complex puzzle solvers with different specialties and skills. We are comprised of mostly USA based students, artists, hackers, etc. The puzzles that we solve are very technical, and operate in categories like reverse engineering, OSINT, PWN, cryptography, blockchain, etc. Hacking really isn't as mystical as it may seem, all it means is that the team is very intelligent, but we hone our skills to drive security and privacy into the future for the better.

The competitive side of these events is global, hosting teams from every technical, occupied nation in the world. If teams compete at a high enough level, there are financial (and other) incentives and rewards. Ranked agains the whole world, Hellbound is 203rd, and we are 24th in the United States. We are only getting better, and we are always on the lookout for talent that is committed to competing.
