As you know, I am Metassassin. I'm an IT professional, CTF team captain, ethical hacker, etc. My dream is to become a penetration tester and social engineer, and I will not stop until I get there - dreaming is not enough for me. 

The team I lead is called <a href="/ctf/">Hellbound, which is a passionate group of bright individuals who love to solve complex puzzles. Feel free to check us out on [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/team/243673).
