## Introduction

Something that has become apparent to me since really diving into the Cybersecurity field, and really professional life, is the need to showcase my skills. I have done a lot of cool stuff, but I have failed myself by not documenting the step-by-step process of solving problems, doing projects, etc. This website is my formal step into the realm of becoming more professional, and I think it may be helpful to create a sort of guide for what it took me to get here, in case you are in the same boat as I. Through outlining my exact process of creating this, I will be repeating some of what the author of this website theme, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>, so I must credit and thank <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat">alshedivat</a> on Github for the amazing work he has done.

## Steps

Creation of this site started with picking a hosting method. I had Github accounts, but I wanted to own one under my primary moniker if I was going to put so much work into it. Of course, Github natively supports Jekyll theming for Github Pages, so that is the route I took.

1.) When your account is created, you can create a new repository if you want to start writing your website yourself, and name it "[username].github.io." At this point I had already done some research and found that I wanted the al-folio theme, and alshedivat makes it really easy to clone the repository by clicking a <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&template_owner=alshedivat">link</a> in the `INSTALL.md` file.

2.) These next few steps are also straight from the `INSTALL.md file`, so I will just paste them here: In this new repository, go to Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions and give Read and write permissions to GitHub Actions.

3.) Open file _config.yml, set url to https://<your-github-username>.github.io and leave baseurl empty (do NOT delete it), as baseurl:.
Wait until the GitHub action with subtitle Deploy site finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~4 min. Now, in addition to the master branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch. While you are here, you can update some additional base information if you want, my _config.yml looks like the following.

<d-code block language="javascript">
  title: Portfolio de Metassassin # the website title (if blank, full name will be used instead)
  first_name: Metassassin
  middle_name:
  last_name: 
  email: metassassin@proton.me
  description: > # the ">" symbol means to ignore newlines until "footer_text:"
    A hacker's professional portfolio.
  footer_text: >
    Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>   theme.
    Hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
  keywords: jekyll, jekyll-theme, academic-website, portfolio-website # add your own keywords or leave empty
  lang: en # the language of your site (for example: en, fr, cn, ru, etc.)
  icon: prof_pic.jpg # the emoji used as the favicon (alternatively, provide image name in /assets/img/)

  url: https://metassassin.github.io # the base hostname & protocol for your site
  baseurl: # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/. Leave blank for root
  last_updated: false # set to true if you want to display last updated in the footer
  impressum_path: # set to path to include impressum link in the footer, use the same path as permalink in a page, helps to conform with EU GDPR
  back_to_top: true # set to false to disable the back to top button
  }
</d-code>

4.) Finally, in the repository page go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, make sure that Source is set to Deploy from a branch and set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to master).

5.) Wait until the GitHub action pages-build-deployment finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~45s, then simply navigate to https://<your-github-username>.github.io in your browser. At this point you should see a copy of the theme's demo website. After everything is set up, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it.

## Problems and Mistakes

Just wrap the text you would like to show up in a footnote in a `<d-footnote>` tag.
The number of the footnote will be automatically generated.<d-footnote>This will become a hoverable footnote.</d-footnote>

---

## Lessons Learned

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com

Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
