## Introduction

Something that has become apparent to me since really diving into the Cybersecurity field, and really professional life, is the need to showcase my skills. I have done a lot of cool stuff, but I have failed myself by not documenting the step-by-step process of solving problems, doing projects, etc. This website is my formal step into the realm of becoming more professional, and I think it may be helpful to create a sort of guide for what it took me to get here, in case you are in the same boat as I. Through outlining my exact process of creating this, I will be repeating some of what the author of this website theme, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a>, so I must credit and thank <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat">alshedivat</a> on Github for the amazing work he has done.

## Steps

Creation of this site started with picking a hosting method. I had Github accounts, but I wanted to own one under my primary moniker if I was going to put so much work into it. Of course, Github natively supports Jekyll theming for Github Pages, so that is the route I took.

1.) When your account is created, you can create a new repository if you want to start writing your website yourself, and name it "[username].github.io." At this point I had already done some research and found that I wanted the al-folio theme, and alshedivat makes it really easy to clone the repository by clicking a <a href="https://github.com/new?template_name=al-folio&template_owner=alshedivat">link</a> in the `INSTALL.md` file.

2.) These next few steps are also straight from the `INSTALL.md` file, so I will just paste them here: In this new repository, go to `Settings -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions` and give Read and write permissions to GitHub Actions.

3.) Open file `_config.yml`, set url to https://<your-github-username>.github.io and leave baseurl empty (do NOT delete it), as baseurl:.
Wait until the GitHub action with subtitle Deploy site finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~4 min. Now, in addition to the master branch, your repository has a newly built gh-pages branch. While you are here, you can update some additional base information if you want.

  {% endhighlight %}
{% enddetails %}

4.) Finally, in the repository page go to `Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment`, make sure that Source is set to Deploy from a branch and set the branch to gh-pages (NOT to master).

5.) Wait until the GitHub action pages-build-deployment finishes (check your repository Actions tab), which takes ~45s, then simply navigate to https://<your-github-username>.github.io in your browser. At this point you should see a copy of the theme's demo website. After everything is set up, you can download the repository to your machine and start customizing it.

6.) To begin customizing my site, I started by editing the home page. I value simplicity in my site, and there are already tabs to share my blog posts and whatnot, so I removed everything but the 'social' section from the `\_layouts\about.liquid` file.

        </article>
      </div>
    {% endraw %}

With the layout adjusted, I was able to quickly and easily update the text in the `/_pages/about.md` file to be what I needed. To change the profile picture, simply navigate the the `/assets/img/` location and replace `prof_pic.jpg` and `prof_pic_color.png` files to the image of your choice. Changing th edescription was 

7.) The next thing I wanted to do was get my CV/resume updated. This part was rather easy - but something to know is that there is a primary `/assets/json/resume.json` file, that contains all of the fields that one may want; however, there is another file for backup called `cv.yml` in the `/_data/` location. Due to the formatting differences and the lack of edits needed, I opted to rename the resume file to `resume1.json` and use the .yml file instead. 

8.) The template thankfully comes with a bunch of different navigation tabs where you can have a blog, post projects, talk about your fellow researchers, etc. For my purposes, I didn't really need all of those things, so I renamed one of the tabs (I believe it was 'people') to document and talk about my CTF team, and I kept the about, blog, and cv pages. The `/_pages/` folder contains all of the pages, and editing that 'people' page really only required updating the permalink, changing the 'nav order,' and finally updating the .md filename to `ctf.md`. Of note, I picked this particular page to edit because the layout worked the best for my purpose, but it is important to note that there are different layouts available in the `/_layouts/` location.

{% details Click here for code %}
  {% highlight javascript %} 
    {% raw %}
      ---
      layout: page
      permalink: /ctf/
      title: ctf
      description: Information and resources around CTFs and my team's history!
      nav: true
      nav_order: 4
      ---
    {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %} 
{% enddetails %}

9.) Similar to the example above, the only adjustments needed to remove pages from the navigation bar was editing the applicable .md files in the `/_pages/` location, changing the 'nav' value to false, and adjusting the 'nav order' to something like '9.' The reason I found the last part to be necessary, was because if a page had 'nav' as false but 'nav order' 2, then there would be a gap in the navigation bar.

10.) With basically everything in order, the final piece before the blog (so I have something presentable while I tackled that beast), was updating the favicon, changing the site footer, adding my desired socials to the home page, and adjusting the tags that are used for indexing posts in the blog. This is all stuff that is handled in the `/config.yml` file. Below are the value changes I made - I will not include all of the text from the file because it is a lot, but maybe it could still be helpful.

The favicon is controlled with a value called 'icon' under the 'site settings.' I just used the profile picture for ease:
{% details Click here for code %}
  {% highlight javascript %} 
    {% raw %}
      icon: prof_pic.jpg
    {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %} 
{% enddetails %}

The only change that the footer needed was removing the picture credits because I won't be using the photos. This was also under 'site settings':
{% details Click here for code %}
  {% highlight javascript %} 
    {% raw %}
      footer_text: >
        Powered by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> with <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> theme.
        Hosted by <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.
    {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %} 
{% enddetails %}

The socials are all under the 'social integration' section. The icons, other than 'RSS' and 'email' only show on the home page if there is a value present, so remove what you don't want, and add what you do. I wanted to keep the RSS and email icons just in case, and I added the following:
{% details Click here for code %}
  {% highlight javascript %} 
    {% raw %}
      discord_id: Metassassin
      github_username: Metassassin
    {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %} 
{% enddetails %}

The blog tags and categories are all controlled within two lines under the 'Jekyll archives' section:
{% details Click here for code %}
  {% highlight javascript %} 
    {% raw %}
      display_tags: ["write-ups", "general", "research", "ideas", "hobby"]
      display_categories: ["hacking", "art", "psychology"]
    {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %} 
{% enddetails %}

## Problems and Mistakes

One of the first problems I ran into with the site was some JSON formatting stuff. This led me to restart and clone my repository, install Jupyter, Ruby and Jekyll locally via Homebrew (I am a Mac user by day), and host my site statically. If you do it this way, don't forget to add Ruby to the $PATH: `echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`.

This worked well because I could run `bundle exec jekyll serve --trace` to 'bundle' the site from the repository file location, go to `httpx[:]//localhost:4000` and view site changes instantly, but then I had issues pushing the changes back up to the Main branch which is an issue that I still have not resolved. For this reason, I ended up going back to editing straight in Github, which is maybe not preferred because it is really easy to break everything and get lost, but I adopted the methodology of only making small changes at a time and actually documenting the changes in the comments so they could easily be reverted if something did break. My commit history is atrocious to say the least, but the site works.

Something additionally interesting about Jekyll running locally, is that when it 'bundled' the site, it created a new folder called `/_site/`. I had not previously done any research about why this may be, but it is a temporary folder. When I was making changes to the blog locally, they kept getting reverted and I couldn't figure out why, but it turned out that I was editing the temporary files. I advise not messing with that temporary folder, it will save you some trouble!

## Lessons Learned

Syntax highlighting is provided within `<d-code>` tags.
An example of inline code snippets: `<d-code language="html">let x = 10;</d-code>`.
For larger blocks of code, add a `block` attribute:

<d-code block language="javascript">
  var x = 25;
  function(x) {
    return x * x;
  }
</d-code>

**Note:** `<d-code>` blocks do not look good in the dark mode.
You can always use the default code-highlight using the `highlight` liquid tag:

{% highlight javascript %}
var x = 25;
function(x) {
return x \* x;
}
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Interactive Plots

You can add interative plots using plotly + iframes :framed_picture:

<div class="l-page">
  <iframe src="{{ '/assets/plotly/demo.html' | relative_url }}" frameborder='0' scrolling='no' height="500px" width="100%" style="border: 1px dashed grey;"></iframe>
</div>

The plot must be generated separately and saved into an HTML file.
To generate the plot that you see above, you can use the following code snippet:

{% highlight python %}
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
df = pd.read_csv(
'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/earthquakes-23k.csv'
)
fig = px.density_mapbox(
df,
lat='Latitude',
lon='Longitude',
z='Magnitude',
radius=10,
center=dict(lat=0, lon=180),
zoom=0,
mapbox_style="stamen-terrain",
)
fig.show()
fig.write_html('assets/plotly/demo.html')
{% endhighlight %}

---

## Details boxes

Details boxes are collapsible boxes which hide additional information from the user. They can be added with the `details` liquid tag:

{% details Click here to know more %}
Additional details, where math $$ 2x - 1 $$ and `code` is rendered correctly.
{% enddetails %}

---

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.
